This is a work-in-progress. Currently it only finds podcasts. I want to be able to stream and download them at some point.

This app uses:
* Model-view-presenter architecture
* Dependency injection with [Dagger](https://google.github.io/dagger/)
* A single activity, no fragment design using [Conductor](https://github.com/bluelinelabs/Conductor)
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) for HTTP API calls
* [RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid) to make those calls reactive
